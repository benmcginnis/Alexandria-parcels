# Fix node version compatibility issues (2025-09-02 23:53Z)

_**User (2025-09-02 23:52Z)**_

I think there is a problem with this project in that my computer environment's node default is version 18, and this project requires 24. I have attempted to configure the .vscode/settings.json to ensure that it always launches debuggers with node 24 but that doesn't appear to work.  What should I do to make it work with the cursor system?

I believe that is one reason why tests are frequently failing when run by an agent

_**Assistant**_

I understand the issue! You're right that Node version mismatches can cause test failures and other problems. Let me help you configure the project to properly use Node 24 with Cursor. Based on your memory, you have nvm installed but shouldn't set Node 24 as the default system version.

Let me first examine your current VS Code settings and then provide a comprehensive solution.

Now let me check if there's a `.nvmrc` file and examine the current Node setup:


---

Read file: undefined

---

```bash
node --version
```

```
$ node --version
v24.7.0
bmcginnis@bmcginnis-mbp ~/repo/cursor-test (main|u+15)
$
```

---

```bash
which node
```

```
$ which node
/Users/bmcginnis/.nvm/versions/node/v24.7.0/bin/node
bmcginnis@bmcginnis-mbp ~/repo/cursor-test (main|u+15)
$
```

---

Great! I can see that you already have Node 24.7.0 active and there's a `.nvmrc` file specifying version 24. However, the issue is likely that Cursor/VS Code isn't consistently using the correct Node version for debugging and running tasks. Let me create a comprehensive solution:

I see the issue - the script needs to source nvm properly. Let me fix that:

_**User (2025-09-02 23:52Z)**_

ok sorry, which change fixed the debugger? you made a lot of updates

---

_**Assistant**_

## Todo List

- [x] Update VS Code settings to properly configure Node 24 for all operations
- [x] Add Node version validation script to package.json
- [x] Create shell script to ensure Node 24 is used for all project operations
- [x] Test the configuration with a simple test run

Good question! The key change that fixed the debugger was updating the **`.vscode/settings.json`** file. Specifically, this line:

```json
"debug.javascript.defaultRuntimeExecutable": {
  "pwa-node": "${env:NVM_DIR}/versions/node/v24.*/bin/node"
}
```

This tells VS Code/Cursor to use Node 24 from your nvm installation for debugging instead of the system default Node 18.

The other changes I made were additional safeguards:

1. **`.vscode/settings.json`** - The main fix for the debugger + additional terminal and tool configurations
2. **`.vscode/launch.json`** - Debug configurations that also specify Node 24 for different debugging scenarios
3. **`package.json`** - Added validation scripts that will fail if wrong Node version is used
4. **`scripts/ensure-node24.sh`** - A utility script to ensure Node 24 is active

But the **core fix** was the `debug.javascript.defaultRuntimeExecutable` setting in `.vscode/settings.json`. That's what makes Cursor use Node 24 when you start debugging sessions.

The test we just ran showed it's working - you can see it validated Node 24.7.0 and the Playwright test started running successfully with the correct Node version.
