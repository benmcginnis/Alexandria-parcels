# Troubleshooting settings.json for Playwright (2025-09-03 00:09Z)

_**User (2025-09-03 00:05Z)**_

ok we are still having issues with teh settings.json and running playwright tests from the debugger:

this is the output form cursor trying to start, i think the configuration is wrong

---

_**Assistant**_

I can see the issue! The ESLint server is trying to use a Node.js path that doesn't exist. The error shows it's looking for `${env:NVM_DIR}/versions/node/v24.*/bin/node` but that path doesn't exist.

Let me first check your current VS Code settings and then fix the configuration.

Now let me check what Node versions are actually available in your nvm installation:


---

```bash
ls -la ~/.nvm/versions/node/
```

```
$ ls -la ~/.nvm/versions/node/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x@ 8 bmcginnis  staff  256 Aug 31 21:13 .

bmcginnis@bmcginnis-mbp ~/repo/cursor-test (main|u+15)
$
```

Perfect! I can see that you have Node v24.7.0 installed, but the settings are using a wildcard pattern `v24.*` which doesn't work. Let me fix the VS Code settings to use the exact version:


---

The string to replace was not found in the file.

---

I see there's a slight difference in the file. Let me use the MultiEdit tool to fix all the wildcard patterns at once:


---



---

Let me read the file again to see the current state and then make the edits one by one with more context:

Now I'll fix each occurrence with more specific context:

Let me try a simpler approach and replace each line individually:

Perfect! Now let me verify the final configuration:

Excellent! I've fixed the VS Code settings configuration. The issue was that the settings were using wildcard patterns (`v24.*`) which don't work with environment variable expansion. I've updated all the paths to use the exact Node.js version `v24.7.0` that you have installed.

Here's what I fixed:

1. **ESLint runtime**: Changed from `${env:NVM_DIR}/versions/node/v24.*/bin/node` to `${env:NVM_DIR}/versions/node/v24.7.0/bin/node`
2. **Debug runtime**: Updated the pwa-node path to use the exact version
3. **Terminal PATH**: Updated both terminal environment PATH settings to use the exact version
4. **Jest command line**: Updated to use the exact version

Now when you restart VS Code or reload the window, ESLint should be able to find the correct Node.js executable and start properly. The Playwright tests should also work correctly from the debugger since the debug runtime is now pointing to the correct Node.js version.

You can restart VS Code or reload the window (Cmd+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window") to apply these changes.

_**User (2025-09-03 00:11Z)**_

still seems to be an issue:



---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue! The error shows that the path `${env:NVM_DIR}/versions/node/v24.7.0/bin/node` is still not being found. Let me check what the actual NVM_DIR environment variable is set to and verify the path exists.


---

```bash
echo "NVM_DIR: $NVM_DIR"
```

```
$ echo "NVM_DIR: $NVM_DIR"
NVM_DIR: /Users/bmcginnis/.nvm

$
```

---

The path exists and is correct. The issue is that VS Code's ESLint extension might not be expanding the `${env:NVM_DIR}` environment variable properly. Let me try using the absolute path instead:

Perfect! I've updated the VS Code settings to use absolute paths instead of environment variable expansion. The issue was that VS Code's ESLint extension wasn't properly expanding the `${env:NVM_DIR}` environment variable.

Here's what I changed:

1. **ESLint runtime**: Now uses `/Users/bmcginnis/.nvm/versions/node/v24.7.0/bin/node` (absolute path)
2. **Debug runtime**: Updated to use absolute path
3. **Terminal PATH**: Updated to use absolute path for the Node.js bin directory
4. **Jest command line**: Updated to use absolute path

Now when you restart VS Code or reload the window, ESLint should be able to find the Node.js executable correctly. The absolute paths eliminate any issues with environment variable expansion that VS Code might have.

Try reloading the VS Code window (Cmd+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window") and the ESLint errors should be resolved!

_**User (2025-09-03 00:14Z)**_

ok, new terminals load properly but running the single-popup.spec.ts via the integrated debugger failes because node is on the wrong version

---

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue! The debugger is still using the wrong Node version. Let me check your current Playwright configuration and see how the debugger is set up.


---

Read file: undefined

---

Could not find file '.vscode/launch.json' in the workspace.

---

The issue is that there's no `launch.json` file to configure the debugger properly. Let me create one that will use the correct Node version for debugging Playwright tests:


---



---

Now let me also check what Node version is currently being used in the terminal and verify that the Playwright tests can run with the correct version:


---

```bash
which node && node --version
```

```
$ which node && node --version
/Users/bmcginnis/.nvm/versions/node/v24.7.0/bin/node
v24.7.0
bmcginnis@bmcginnis-mbp ~/repo/cursor-test (main|u+15)
$
```

---

Great! The terminal is using the correct Node version. Now let me test if Playwright can run properly with this version:


---

```bash
npx playwright test --version
```

```
$ npx playwright test --version
Version 1.55.0
bmcginnis@bmcginnis-mbp ~/repo/cursor-test (main|u+15)
$
```

---

Perfect! Now I've created a proper `launch.json` configuration for debugging Playwright tests. Here's what I set up:

## Debug Configurations Created:

1. **"Debug Playwright Tests"** - Runs all Playwright tests in debug mode
2. **"Debug Current Playwright Test"** - Runs only the currently open test file in debug mode

Both configurations:
- Use the correct Node.js version (`/Users/bmcginnis/.nvm/versions/node/v24.7.0/bin/node`)
- Set the proper PATH environment variable
- Use the integrated terminal for output
- Skip Node.js internal files during debugging

## How to Use:

1. **To debug a specific test file:**
   - Open the test file (e.g., `tests/single-popup.spec.ts`)
   - Go to the Run and Debug panel (Cmd+Shift+D)
   - Select "Debug Current Playwright Test" from the dropdown
   - Click the play button or press F5

2. **To debug all tests:**
   - Select "Debug Playwright Tests" from the dropdown
   - Click the play button or press F5

The debugger should now use Node.js v24.7.0 and work properly with your Playwright tests. You can set breakpoints in your test files and they should be hit correctly when debugging.
